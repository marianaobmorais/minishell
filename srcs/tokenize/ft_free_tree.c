 * different node types such as ROOT, AND, OR, PIPE, SUB_ROOT, EXEC, and REDIR,
 * ensuring all relevant structures (e.g., argument lists for EXEC nodes,
 * target lists for REDIR nodes) are properly freed.
 *
 * - For nodes of type `PIPE`,it recursively frees the left and right subtrees.
 * - For nodes of type `EXEC`, `EXPORT`, or `EXPORT_AP`, it frees the argument
 *   list (`args`).
 * - For redirection nodes (`OUTFILE`, `INFILE`, `APPEND`, `HEREDOC`), it frees
 *   the target list (`target`) and any subsequent tokens (`next`).
 * - After processing the node's contents, it frees the node itself.
